# Pulkit Arora — engineering portfolio

A complete React 18 + Vite portfolio with a locally bundled font pair, Three.js/R3F sculpture, custom GLSL, GSAP SplitText and ScrollTrigger, Lenis, Zustand, Framer Motion, Lucide, and Tailwind CSS. No remote images, 3D models, API keys, or paid animation plugins are required.

## Run

Use Node.js 20.19+ (or 22.12+). In this folder:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

The terminal prints the local URL. Build using `npm run build`; inspect the production output using `npm run preview`. Deploy the generated `dist` folder to any static host. Use HTTPS in production. Vite's development server is for local development only.

## Personalize

Profile content is drawn from https://pulkitarora.vercel.app/ and centralized in `src/data/content.js`: identity, biography, metrics, repository links, resume, work experience, packages, education, and leadership. Project covers are illustrative technology diagrams based on each published stack, not product screenshots. Dates and results retain the source profile’s claims. The original site does not give project dates or company names, so no values are invented. Optional testimonials are omitted.

The theme tokens, fluid type, responsive layout and motion fallbacks live in `src/styles.css` and `tailwind.config.js`. Fonts are packaged through @fontsource and self-hosted by Vite. Hero shaders live in `src/scenes/shaders.js`.

## Contact delivery

By default the validated form opens the visitor's email app with a complete draft; it never claims to have sent an email. The email recipient is pulkitarora0714@gmail.com, as listed on the source portfolio.

For direct submission, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `VITE_CONTACT_ENDPOINT` to your HTTPS form service or backend. It must accept JSON `{ name, email, message, website }`, allow your site's origin through CORS, and return a successful HTTP status only after accepting the message. Validate inputs, enforce length limits, reject populated honeypots, and implement rate limits on that service. Keep secret API keys there, never in a VITE_ variable. Failed or timed-out submissions preserve the draft. Rebuild after changing environment variables.

## Interaction and accessibility

- Native dialog handles modal semantics, Escape and focus containment; focus returns to the opening card. Background scrolling is suspended while it is open.
- Work arrows and keyboard focus support the pinned desktop gallery. Touch screens and reduced-motion mode use a native horizontal scroller.
- The header motion button pauses decorative animation. The operating-system reduced-motion preference always takes precedence.
- Major GSAP effects clean up through contexts. Declarative Three.js geometries/materials dispose through R3F. Mobile uses a simpler material and lower geometry/particle counts. Rendering stops offscreen; reduced-motion scenes use demand rendering.
- The canvas is decorative and hidden from assistive technology. Its raycast hover deformation is optional; all portfolio information is regular HTML.
- Motion targets efficient transforms; actual frame rate depends on GPU, browser and screen resolution. No fixed 60fps guarantee is made.
- The contact surface uses a lightweight particle shader on desktop and static SVG turbulence on mobile or reduced-motion devices. The single-page design needs no route transitions.

## Source organization

`src/components` contains one component per section or reusable interaction. `src/scenes` contains the lazy-loaded WebGL scene and shaders. `src/hooks` handles motion and smooth scrolling. `src/lib` owns animation setup and shared state. `src/data` contains editable content. `public` holds the favicon and accessible backend-systems diagram.

GSAP SplitText usage follows https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText/ . React Three Fiber 8 is paired with React 18. Dependency licenses apply to their respective packages.
